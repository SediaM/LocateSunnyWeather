# LocateSunnyWeather

## Description 

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Built here is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) is used to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## Usage

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs.
WHEN I search for a city.
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city.
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city.
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
WHEN I click on a city in the search history.
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
